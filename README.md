All notes are draggable, enabling users to position them anywhere on the board for better organization and visualization.
#$ 2. Adding New Notes
Users can easily add new notes by clicking on the "+" button, providing a seamless experience for expanding the board with additional information.

Each note includes an "x" button, allowing users to delete unwanted notes effortlessly and declutter the board.
